# The Analysis of Exercise On Students Academic Performance

## Overview
This project investigates how regular physical exercise influences the academic performance of college students. By analyzing survey data, we aimed to identify any correlations between exercise frequency and academic success.

## Research Focus
- **Research Question**: Does regular physical exercise improve academic performance in college students?
- **Hypothesis**: Students who exercise regularly will perform better academically than those who do not.

## Methodology
- **Population**: College students
- **Sampling Method**: Convenience sampling
- **Data Collection**: Online survey with questions about exercise frequency and academic performance

## Findings
- A moderate positive relationship between regular exercise and academic performance was observed.
- Results indicate the need for further research with a larger sample size and control for additional variables.

## Conclusion
Regular exercise may positively impact academic performance, but more extensive studies are required to confirm this finding.

## Potential Issues
- Small sample size
- Potential biases in data collection and analysis
